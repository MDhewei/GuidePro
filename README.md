# GuidePro:sgRNA Selection for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated Protein Knockouts

GuidePro is a two-layer ensemble predictor that enables the integration of multiple predictive methods and feature sets to predict sgRNA efficiency for the CRISPR/Cas9 protein knockouts! It integrates three sub-predictors trained with different types of features that jointly contribute to protein knockouts:i) The first predictor (OTA) predicts sgRNA on-target activity. ii) The second predictor (FSP) predicts the frameshift probabilities. iii) The third predictor (CKS) predicts the CRISPR knockout sensitivity from protein features(see Figure below).
