This document specifies the contents of testing dataset1 for the validation of predicted CRISPR/Cas9 on-target protein knockout efficiency.


#results

Spearman_correlation_dependent_datasets.tsv
Includes Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted efficiency and experimental outcomes Essential_Zscore.


#log files:

log_add_protein_features_testset1.tsv
Includes updated symbol and locus when comparing original sgRNA information with protein feature annotation. 'NA': the original symbol & locus are not found in the annotation.

log_add_CRISPRO_score_testset1.tsv
Includes updated double strand break (DSB) locus, gene name and amino acid locus at DSB when comparing original sgRNA information with protein feature annotation. 'NA': the original DSB is not annotated.


#testing data: all the *.csv files.
